A project for COGS 120/CSE 170, Interation Design.

It is difficult to grow as a creative person when you're on your own, so connecting designers to a larger network of different people can help them collaborate to learn from each other and gain feedback and inspiration for improvement. Our user base are young student designers interested in entering the industry with moderate to no experience. We are focusing primarily on designers, especially ones that seek creative growth, and providing them with a space to connect, support, and give each other feedback to help each other grow creatively. Originally we were intending for any artist for any type of work, but since then we have recognized that the audience would be too large, and the features we intended to tailor to all audiences was unrealistic for this project’s timeline.


Our chosen studio brief is Collective Creativity, and through our app to bring designers together, we seek to help individuals improve their work with the feedback of other individuals, thus facilitating collaboration. For example, a beginner designer in their first year of college would be stunted in creative growth if their network is simply their close friends and family who may not even be in the design industry at all. To get more helpful feedback, this designer could create a post on our app to share their work, specify the type of feedback they’d like to receive, and other users like them could review and leave annotated comments. With that, the user could improve on their work and grow as a creative designer.
